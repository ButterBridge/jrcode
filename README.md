# jrcode

The source code for my blog website, www.jrcode.co.uk/.

Please feel free to submit issues or even pull requests, especially regarding bugs, mobile browsers, or feature requests.

This is built on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), from a rather butchered version of [this cool starter](https://github.com/AustinGreen/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms). It continuously deploys from the master branch on this repo, from direct changes to the source code or via [Netlify's CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/).

It's about my experience teaching and developing at [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/), Manchester UK's coding bootcamp - and some stuff on the side too :)
