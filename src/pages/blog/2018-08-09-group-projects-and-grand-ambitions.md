  How to do code to teach code

The day before I go on holidays for a week, we are about to embark on a grand scheme - creating a set of teaching tools, not for the students, but for us.

## What matters

There can be any number of frustrations in working with third party software, but those frustrations are compounded when you know within your company you have the skills to make something better - if only you had the time. Well, we're fianlly about to embark on a project which will put to good use the development skills that exist at Northcoders, so we can make the teaching skills even more effective.

Here are some of the issues:

*Automation* - there are several regular tasks which take more clicks than one would like: sharing repos and notes, feedback forms, slack reminders, internal review documents. But there are all hosted on apis that we have access to, and turning these tasks into a one-button click absolves the need for having to go downstairs to get your phone becasue in a moment of self-righteousness you enabled two-factor authentication, or remembering the exact name we gave to a sprint (was it dance-party / play-list / music-tracker / audio-documenter...?)

*Spread* - we have resources dotted around the interweb across several different services - slack, github, heroku, firebase, a packet of post-it notes we opened, wrote something vitally important on, then left in a draw. Sometimes even knowing which service hosts the information isn't a given. Creating one space that drew the key information together would make for a pleasant open-up-your-laptop-with-a-coffee-by-your-side start of day experience.

*Analytics* - By tying all the information together, it'ss far easier to perform the sort of analyses that could better inform our practise - what are people asking for help with the most? Is there a time of day we need to have more support available? Can we have available solutions from previous similar requests?

## Teamwork -> dreamwork

Perhaps the most exciting thing about this project is the collaborative aspect. We're putting aside staggered development time for each member of the teaching team, so they can catch up on what's being done at the start of the first week, and feed this information to the next person at the start of the second week. It's a system that could easily fall apart if we're not strict with ourselves on the standards we apply at the start - linting rules, commit practices, data structuring and design guidelines in particular.

The other thing we need to keep a lid on is 'feature creep'. For example, I cannot wait to implement a progress bar for each staff member on the number of help requests they have responded to. It's not a triviality - some friendly comptetition could help up our game in this respect. But neither is it essential - there's plenty of more useful data that needs shifting around first.

Look forward to updating on the trials and tribulations on the way.
