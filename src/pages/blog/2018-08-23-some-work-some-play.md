A while back a wrote a blog called 'All I Want For Christmas Is Code'. I wrote it in March, but that's by the by. Some day I'll post it again here but the crux of it was that there is no better creative medium than code, whether that was as a writer with something like [Twine](http://twinery.org/) or a livecoding visual artist with something like [livecodelab](http://livecodelab.net/). We're in a place now where few few people's creative imagination exceeds the boundaries of possibility in programming.

## A Playful Realm

I've played around with [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) and I know that I'm a long way off creating a fully-fledged and enjoyable 'game' (whatever that means). But my web skills are coming on and I have no intention of leaving the idea of play behind. I'm working on integrating a 'game' (I'm using the same word as before, but it's a different ball... game) into this site, not because this is a gaming site, but because people like to play. It's *playable*, sort of, but a bit hidden away - but if you mess around with your mouse in the top left corner you might get some idea as to the aim of it (desktop only at the moment, sorry).

This isn't some sort of revolutionary act. Google have been running their [doodles](https://www.google.com/doodles) since 1998 and a new interactive one would occasionally create something of a stir in our uni house. And I suppose I am the only person not to have known this but a student recently informed me that the picture of the dinosaur on a barren landscape that appears on working offline in Chrome is a playable platformer.

## Drawn In

One of the reasons I never pursued Unity was that I am no artist, and I will never have the design skills that would mean I wouldn't be sinking endless cash into other people's art, if I was to achieve what was in my mind. With something a bit more capricious and trivial on the side like what I'm doing here, it is at its worst a reason to practise my CSS.

It's also just a distinctive mark. I've seen some neat transitions and animations on other people's blogs, that I could try and ape if I wanted. But a little interactive flavour on the side, something I can turn to every so often when I'm losing focus on something more, *ahem*, serious - I haven't seen that before. If you have, please let me know so I can steal it.

I will share in due course how I'm approaching some of this - there will be local storage, there already is React context, there may be realtime Firebase in the future. For now, just have a play,
