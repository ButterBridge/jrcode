### About me
My name is Jonny Rathbone and I teach at Manchester's coding bootcamp, Northcoders. We put about ten highly capable junior devs out across the north of the UK every two weeks. You can read more about Northcoders [here](https://northcoders.com/).

Dev work at Northcoders includes the reimplementation of the above public facing website, as well as the creation of teaching tools including abstractions of software like [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and [p5js](https://p5js.org/) so new students can make use of the functionality without having to understand syntax they don't know yet. We also have our ongoing classroom team development software, with realtime data powered with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) alongside SQL, and rendered in brand spanking new [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) integration testing.

### My tech...
All things **JavaScript**, but mainly [React](https://reactjs.org/) on the front-end (this site is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) at the back (though this one is on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)). I've got to know [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) pretty well too, but mostly [PSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for databases.

### Otherwise...
I'll be hanging around with my awesome wife and kids, playing computer games, watching films, making music, reading, cooking or any of those other things that make me a real human being.
